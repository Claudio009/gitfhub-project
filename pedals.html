                           <div class="guitar_name"> <h3>GOLD BOOST</h3> </div>
                           <div class="guitar_image"><img src="./img/pedal_1.png" width="350px" height="390px"></div>
                           <div class="guitar_info"> <p>For the most part, boosts are very simple to build. Nonetheless, they are often the most versatile and most important component on a pedal board. This is especially true of the 100% analog Gold Boost, because of its high input impedance (ca. 4.7 MOhm), which activates even the guitar’s most outlying – and perhaps even forgotten – treble regions. Many liken this effect to pulling away a curtain that had been hanging in front of the amplifier.

With its super linear frequency path, however, the Gold Boost can also be engaged as a pure buffer. All it takes is striken counterclockwise the pedal’s one pot. This transforms the instrument signal with high impedance into an output signal with significantly lower impedance – all at the most sophisticated level of sound. The signal meanwhile retains total transparency, strength and dynamics, as well as its full tone – even with long cable pathways and complex effects setups. At higher boost levels (above the 12 o’clock pot setting), trebles are dampened slightly, which will noticeably improve the sound of an overdriven (tube) amp.</p> </div>


                        <div class="guitar_name"> <h3>VIOLET TREM</h3> </div>
                        <div class="guitar_image"><img src="./img/pedal_2.png" width="350px" height="390px"></div>
                        <div class="guitar_info"> <p>The pulsing tremolo effect is probably the most magical of all guitar effects. The Violet Trem has a hand calibrated and synchronized photo cell at the heart of its electronics, by which the buttery “wet” tremolo sound we’ve come to know and love from the old tube amps is perfectly reproduced. The Violet Trem has a volume control that counterbalances loss of volume that can occur with active effects. Or it can as a booster; left-striking the intensity regulator turns the Violet Trem into either a booster or a buffer, with all the advantages these effects bring with them. A switch enables the choice between hard square or soft sine waveforms, thereby offering two tremolo directions that could not be more different from each other: vintage meets modern – so then, Dick Dale can surf over here, while the “stutter” effect of Tom Morello can thunder over there. Meanwhile, the Status LED light pulses in time with the tremolo’s wave frequencies.

With its True Bypass electronics, the Violet Trem remains absolutely sound neutral when not in an active state.</p> </div>

                        <div class="guitar_name"> <h3>GREEN COMP II</h3> </div>
                        <div class="guitar_image"><img src="./img/pedal_3.png" width="350px" height="360px"></div>
                        <div class="guitar_info"> <p>The Green Comp helps the guitar attain a fat and balanced sound, brilliant overtones and a creamy sustain that – at certain settings – seems to last forever. No country musician can afford to be without a compressor/sustainer, and even in the blues and rock genres, this useful tool has become standard on pedal boards for the way that it improves sound and boosts solo parts.

Our technicians have combined into one their knowledge of traditional compressor sounds and their understanding of solid construction techniques in order to make a pedal that is satisfying to use even under hard live-play conditions. Because of effective True Bypass electronics, the Green Comp II in its inactivated state remains absolutely sound-neutral. Like all Duesenberg effects, the Green Comp II is built according to the highest technological standards, is simple to use and built to withstand wear and tear on the road.

                        <div class="guitar_image"><img src="./img/pedal_4.png" width="350px" height="360px"></div>
                        <div class="guitar_info"> <p>The new “All in One Pedal”. The CHANNEL 2 is fantastic as an Overdrive/Distortion and just great with any Amp/Guitar combination.. The CHANNEL 2 works just like an extra channel providing you with a great transparent crunch tone to a heavy overdrive. The CHANNEL 2 will be the ticket in saving the day when you don't have your full rig and the show must go on.</p> </div>
