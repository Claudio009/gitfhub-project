                           <div class="guitar_image"><img src="./img/Guitar1.png" width="310px" height="150px"></div>
                           <div class="guitar_info"> <p>The body of the Alliance Series Johnny Depp is made from American alder combined with an ash top. On top of that, there is an aluminum top plate in which we etched a selection of his personal tattoos. The tattoos were photographed from Johnny's body and redrawn by an artist to have them then applied onto the aluminum top.
                               What makes this guitar even more unique is the custom tapped JD-63 pickup which was specially designed to meet every characteristic of a classic open sounding single coil. Taking it a step further we offer the option of adding 1963 turns of pickup wire (1963 is Johnnyâ€™s year of birth) to the signal creating a warmer and crunchier tone. This guitar also offers our classic Diamond Deluxe Tremola continuing the Duesenberg tradition.

                        <div class="guitar_name"> <h3>CARIBOU</h3> </div>
                        <div class="guitar_image"><img src="./img/Guitar2.png" width="310px" height="150px"></div>
                        <div class="guitar_info"> <p>The Caribou is a chambered, dual pickup, 22 fret electric guitar, featuring a Cat Eye F-Hole and a 647mm scale. It is also available as a 12-string edition.

The Caribou is made from solid Alder in which we route large sound chambers. The body is then fitted with a flat maple top featuring a modern Cat Eye F-Hole. The large sound chambers make this construction a crossover between a solidbody and a semi-hollow construction, resulting in a unique tonal character and resonance.

The Caribou is fitted with our proven Duesenberg pickup combination, comprising of the classicly wound GrandVintage humbucker for the bridge and the warm and creamy Domino P90 singlecoil. The middle position of both pickups features a special wiring, which splits certain low end frequencies out of the humbucker's signal, resulting in an open and extremely versatile addition to your pallet of sounds. The Caribou 12-string edition is equipped with two Domino P90 singlecoils.

Following the tradition of vintage German guitar building, we select Spruce as our choice wood for the top. When you turn the guitar around, you will see that we chose flamed maple for the back and sides, which slightly shimmers through the translucent finish.

The DLX is fitted with our classically wound GrandVintage humbucker for the bridge position, giving you clear and balanced tone in any situation. The neck position sports our D-Tron humbucker, which is known for its distinct sparkling voice.
Each pickup can be individually modified with our Vario-Tone controls, which allow you to scoop certain frequencies out of the signal, giving you endless options to personalize your tone.</p> </div>
