The frame of this amp is made from wood which is then painted with a thin layer of metal particles. The metal coat is then processed and aged by hand, giving it the distinctive rusty patina which makes each build completely unique.

Inside, there is a 7025 High Grade combined with a 12AX7 for the preamp and two 6L6WGC tubes for the power amp. These are pushing all the raw tone straight to the speaker. We started with a clean channel and ended up with a great, bright and dynamic tone with straight forward Treble, Mid, Bass and Volume controls.
The internal boost section allows you to extend the clean channel. It boosts your clean signal without changing the overall texture of your tone. Additionally, the boost section can be fine tuned with Gain, Level and Contour controls.
