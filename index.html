                        <h1 class="titles">Retro-Design and Innovative Technology</h1>

                        <p>The fascination of the shapes and colours in the 40's and 50's and the permanent search for technical innovation were the driving forces. A good balance between respectful analysis of the classic constructions and designs on the one hand, and careful improvement and optimization of the techical details are the solid base that the brand Duesenberg is seated on today.</p>

                        <h1 class="titles">Art Deco</h1>

                        <p>One of the most important reasons for Duesenberg's success is the unique design concept. It is Dieter Gölsdorf's very own interpretation of the Art Deco style, which gives the intruments their distinctive appearance. Almost every part from the tuner knobs, the trussrod cover and the pickguard to the little switch knob ist exclusively manufactured for us, and features our trade mark: the three steps. They stand for what Duesenberg is - always <b>THREE STEPS AHEAD!</b></p>

                        <h1 class="titles">Innovation</h1>

                        <p>Hidden behind the pretty facade there are numerous technical innovations, which are sometimes only discovered at second sight. The Z-Tuners allow easy and comfortable restringing. The tilt of the pickups can be adjusted by a third screw in the pickup ring, so that the surface of the pickup can be aligned with the strings. And last but not least the Duesenberg Deluxe Tremola, which is one of the best systems available on the market today.

Single coil sound withound hum - generations of engineers tried in vain to solve this problem. We did it - with our PH90 SingleTwin pickup. And another detail that musicians all over the world love is the straightforward usability of the Duesenberg instruments. It is the simple but unique pickup wiring - easy to use but offering a wide range of sounds.

There are still countless ideas and concepts in Dieter Gölsdorf's drawer that are waiting to be made.</p>
